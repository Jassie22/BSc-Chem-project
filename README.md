A project to maximise the energy density of the azo-dye 'Disperse Orange 1' using 5 different solvents with varying polarities and a range of temperatures.

I concluded that:
- the isomerisation reaction's dominant mechanism is the inversion mechanism around the N=N axis without bond cleavage
- Higher temperatures lead to a decrease in energy density
- At higher temperatures, a larger proportion of the azo-dye undergoes isomerisation
- lower polarities of solvents lead to smaller k values, leading to larger energy densities
  

See 'Flash Photolysis Report - Jasmeen Dahak' for more details on the research.
